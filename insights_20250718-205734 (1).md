## Global Summary

The simulation indicates a total of 7,565 agents across 8 clusters, with varying infection rates. The highest infection rate is observed in cluster 1 at 178.27, while the lowest is in cluster 5 at 69.29. This suggests significant heterogeneity in transmission dynamics, necessitating tailored interventions for each cluster to mitigate risk.

## Cluster Analysis

### Cluster -1
- **Behavioural Description**: This large cluster of 3,246 agents exhibits high interaction rates, contributing to significant disease transmission.
- **Risk Assessment**: With an infection rate of 80.10 and 260,000 acquired infections, the risk is substantial due to high mobility and interaction.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Enhanced contact tracing.
  2. Strict mobility restrictions.

### Cluster 0
- **Behavioural Description**: Comprising 551 agents, this cluster shows high interaction with facilities, increasing exposure risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 80.94 indicates a high likelihood of transmission, especially in communal settings.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Facility access limitations.
  2. Promotion of remote interactions.

### Cluster 1
- **Behavioural Description**: The smallest cluster with 451 agents, it has the highest infection rate, indicating intense transmission.
- **Risk Assessment**: An alarming infection rate of 178.27, with 80,400 infections, highlights extreme caution needed.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Immediate lockdown measures.
  2. Mass testing and isolation protocols.

### Cluster 2
- **Behavioural Description**: This cluster has 1,016 agents and high facility interaction, raising infection risks.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 82.68 suggests moderate to high risk, especially in crowded environments.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Increased mask mandates.
  2. Limiting gatherings.

### Cluster 3
- **Behavioural Description**: With 633 agents, this cluster is characterized by diverse location interactions.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 112.48 indicates significant transmission potential, necessitating caution.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Enhanced public health messaging.
  2. Targeted vaccination campaigns.

### Cluster 4
- **Behavioural Description**: This cluster includes 823 agents, showing moderate interaction patterns.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 83.35 suggests a need for vigilance and preventive measures.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Community engagement initiatives.
  2. Regular health screenings.

### Cluster 5
- **Behavioural Description**: Comprising 407 agents, this cluster shows lower interaction rates, but still poses risks.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 69.29 indicates lower risk but still requires monitoring.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Educational campaigns on hygiene.
  2. Encouragement of vaccination.

### Cluster 6
- **Behavioural Description**: This cluster has 438 agents with moderate interaction levels.
- **Risk Assessment**: An infection rate of 71.69 suggests a cautious approach is warranted.
- **Intervention Levers**: 
  1. Promotion of remote work.
  2. Health education initiatives.

## Cross-Cluster Infection Pathways

1. **Cluster 2 to Cluster 3**: High interaction (30 cases). 
   - **Breaking Strategy**: Implement strict movement controls between these clusters.
   
2. **Cluster 3 to Cluster 4**: Significant flow (27 cases).
   - **Breaking Strategy**: Strengthen health checks at transition points between clusters.

3. **Cluster 4 to Cluster 2**: Notable interaction (26 cases).
   - **Breaking Strategy**: Enforce mandatory mask-wearing in shared spaces to reduce transmission risk.

By employing these targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the spread of infection can be effectively mitigated across clusters.
